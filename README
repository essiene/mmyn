Introduction
============
Mmayen (shortened as Mmyn) is an SMPP Application Gateway.

Initial support is on SMPP 3.4 only.

Focus in on:
    1. High system uptime: 
       The system should be generally up. A system crash should be regarded 
       as a major category 1 fault.

    2. High connectivity longetivity: 
       When we open a connection, it should generally stay up. Disconnecting 
       and reconnecting though possible and supported should be regarded as 
       a massive evil.

    3. High transmit throughput per transmitter:
       Each transmitter should be able to perform to close to 99% of its raw
       abilities. As much as possible, the design of the system should impose
       as little overhead on the raw capabilities of the channel.

    4. Ease of scaling out transmitter:
       With each transmitter performing at wicked levels, we should be able to
       easily spin up more transmitters to have exponential wickedness in 
       terms of throughput.

    5. High receive throughput:
       See item 3.

    6. Ease of scaling out receiver 
       See item 4.

    7. Agressive Queing:
       Rx and Tx should be backed by queues.

    8. Queue TTL support:
       Even though queues are employed, we should be able to set a Queue Time
       To Live (TTL). This will allow the system to offer some sort of time
       basic guarantees.

    9. Application latency awareness:
       When TTLs are employed, the application server should be aware of the
       latencies and throughputs of each of the application servers used to
       service Rx requests. These will affect how the TTL is applied to a
       packet at dequeue time. This also helps us to give proper reports on
       who is dragging us backwards.

    10.TTL flexibility:
       Points 8 and 9 above should be easily turned on and off

Building
========
Mmayen is built with rebar. It is conveniently wrapped with a Makefile

First obtain from github:

    $ git clone http://github.com/essiene/mmyn.git

Then run make

    $ make

The Makefile will fetch all the dependencies and then build Mmayen.


Making A Release
================

To run Mmayen, you must make an OTP release:

    $ make release

The release will be located in $PWD/rel/mmyn
