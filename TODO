* nanny:add_rx() times out before it returns
* Implement incremental backoff on idleness and accelerating
  catchup on busy times for all repeatitive tasks
* implement a pluggin framework in the rx module that allows the
  rx to notify all registered callbacks, instead of just the one
  callback.

  In this framework, define an gen_sms behaviour that all plugins
  will implement. This gen_sms behaviour module will also export
  gen_sms:send(Src, Dst, Msg), which will use preconfigured defaults
  for the plugin for the remaining #submit_sm{} parameters
