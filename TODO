* implement a pluggin framework in the rx module that allows the
  rx to notify all registered callbacks, instead of just the one
  callback.

  In this framework, define an gen_sms behaviour that all plugins
  will implement. This gen_sms behaviour module will also export
  gen_sms:send(Src, Dst, Msg), which will use preconfigured defaults
  for the plugin for the remaining #submit_sm{} parameters
* Make use of erlcfg
* Make use of log4erl?
* add commands to simreg script via nodetool:
    start/stop/status tx_nanny
    start/stop/status rx_nanny
    start/stop/status webservice
    start/stop/status txq
    add/remove/view sms alert list
    send an sms
    get statistics on webservice tps
    get statistics on tx 
    get statistics on rx tps

* Pull out all other constants into config file
* Stopping the application does not clean-up the esme's properly :(
* backoff DETS garbage collection
* When nanny goes down, take down your kids dammit!!!
  alternatively, find a way to make it such that a new nanny
  will discover the kids which are still alive,

* In backoff, instead of using a DETS, still use an ETS, but implement
  dynamic registration, so a client can register if its not already 
  registered and see if its possible to also let a backoff module
  discover clients who want its services...
