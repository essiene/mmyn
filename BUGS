When a consumer to rxq:async_pop dies, cleanup its POP request, or
the message inbox overflows and rxq stops responding

Whenever we make a gen_server:call, we have to properly respond if timeouts occur.
Basically, handle this condition so the VM stays up, but we reject the requests,
also make the timeouts to gen_server:call's configurable, so we can increase
the vm timeout window.
